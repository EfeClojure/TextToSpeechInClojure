When you run the program, you type in something and it'll get spoken back to you.

You'll have to have leiningen setup. 

Run lein deps from the project's directory, in order to get all the 
dependencies for the project.

Then do lein run from the project's directory to see the program in action.

There is a bit of plagiarism involved  here. I simply cleaned up the code a bit
and made it work on Windows.
